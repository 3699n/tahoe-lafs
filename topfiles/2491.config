* tub.port is now an Endpoint server specification string (which is pretty
  much just like a strports string, but can be extended by plugins). It now
  rejects "tcp:0" and "0". The tahoe.cfg value overrides anything stored on
  disk (in client.port). This should have no effect on most nodes, which do
  not set tub.port in tahoe.cfg, and wrote an allocated port number to
  client.port the first time they launched. Folks who want to listen on a
  specific port number typically set tub.port to "tcp:12345" or "12345", not
  "0".
* The "portnumfile" (e.g. NODEDIR/client.port) is written as soon as the port
  is allocated, before the tub is created, and only if "tub.port" was empty.
  The old code wrote to it unconditionally, and after Tub startup. So if the
  user allows NODEDIR/client.port to be written, then later modifies
  tahoe.cfg to set "tub.port" to a different value, this difference will
  persist (and the node will honor tahoe.cfg "tub.port" exclusively).
